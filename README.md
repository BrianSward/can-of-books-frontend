Slack

How often will you take breaks?
Approx 10-15 min/hour of work

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
Use resources provided by Codefellows like TA support, fellow students, and our professor

Cooperative

Make a list of each person's strengths.
Brian - math, logic
Xavier - jack of all trades, down to try anything once

How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
By combining our resources and approaching problems in a healthy and productive fashion

In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
Brian (using debugging tools and understanding how to get stuff to appear in a console.log)
Xavier (develop greater strength at all around programming skills)

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
Assign tasks to each other and then come together when problems arise

Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
Talk about it, make sure everyone is working on tasks they can accomplish, reassigning when necessary

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
Voice your opinion on those parts of the project you specifically want to contribute on

How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Keeping honest and open communication open where we ask for help as needed
